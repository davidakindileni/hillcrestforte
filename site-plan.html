      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Would you describe your current business or service as a growing entity? Growing can be defined as improved operations and procedures, opening more branches or outlets, making more sales, getting more customers, making more profit, increasing the use of modern technology (such as the internet, computerization, and social media).<br><br>
      Great companies, businesses, and services of the world did not get there by chance or by accident. They learned, practiced, and implemented methods and processes that facilitated and ensured that their businesses grew. You too can do the same.<br><br>
        At <b>Hillcrest Forte Services Company</b>, we help nurture your business to success. We pool together our years of experience to provide you premium business development services. We examine and audit your company and its operations, and we identify and recommend measures that will ensure that your business grow now and in the future.<br><br>
      So, let's help you get that business off the ground or ensure that it continues to grow. Give us a call now!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target customers are new start-ups and small-medium enterprises (SME). Most entrepreneurs know the kind of businesses and services that they would like to provide to customers. However, they lack the knowledge, experience, and skills on how to set up a company, organize and run it efficiently. We provide instructional training and hands-on experience to these proprietors on a contract or consultancy basis.<br><br>
      For large corporate organizations and businesses, we offer business development and operational audits to help them in identifying their areas of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). We assist these clients in turning weaknesses into strengths and threats to opportunities.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        <b>Businesses are meant to Grow</b><br><br>
        
        Every business is established for a purpose. Regardless of the purpose, businesses are meant to be living entities. In other words, businesses are meant to grow. So, how do you know, or how do you measure if your business is growing? Having a large customer base, impressive number of sales outlets, making good sales returns every day are not proof that your business is thriving. The bottom line is to examine if your business is achieving the purpose for which it was created – be it profit-making or otherwise.</p>

        Just as medical doctors can help us examine our bodies to see if they are functioning well, Hillcrest Forte Services Company specializes in carrying out various tests, surveys, and analyis to determine the functionality and viability of your business. We go further to prescribe solutions to any detected or observed problems and help you (if required) to implement those solutions. After they are implemented and the desired results are being achieved, we continue with you to that point where we can ensure that there will be no reverses.</p>
