      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Would you describe your current business or service as a growing entity? Growing can be defined as improved operations and procedures, opening more branches or outlets, making more sales, getting more customers, making more profit, increasing the use of modern technology (such as the internet, more computerization, and social media).<br><br>
      Great companies, businesses, and services of the world did not get there by chance or by accident. They learned, followed, practiced, and implemented things to facilitate and ensure that their businesses grew. You too can do the same.<br><br>
      At <b>Davakin Integrated Services Company</b>, we help nurture your business to success. We garner our years of experience to provide you premium business development services. We examine and audit your company and its operations, identifying and recommending actions that will ensure your business growth now and in the future.<br><br>
      So, do you want to ensure that your business or service is growing? Give us a call â€¦ NOW!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target customers are new start-ups and small-medium enterprises (SME). Most entrepreneurs have great ideas of businesses and services that they would like to provide to customers. However, they lack the knowledge, experience, and skills on how to set up a company, organize and run it efficiently. We would provide instructional training and hands-on experience to these proprietors on a project contract or consultancy basis.<br><br>
      We seek large corporate organizations and businesses for business development and operational audits to help in identifying areas of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). We would assist these clients in turning weaknesses into strengths and threats to opportunities.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
